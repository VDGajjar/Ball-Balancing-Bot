3. 2 Metal gear Servo Motor MG995
4. 12V DC Power Adapter
5. Jumper Wires
6. LM2596 DC-DC Buck converter
7. Breadboard
8. DST
9. Wooden Base (16 x 16 inch )
10. Acrylic Top (15 x 15 inch )

**Software:**

â€¢ [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)

# Instruction on using source code

Our overall code consists of three sub files. One of them is the main file and others consists of only functions or methods definitions which are called/used in the main file. All the subfiles have been uploaded in github. First, you have to download them all and put them in a folder that has the same name as that of the main file (In our case, &quot;code.ino&quot; is the main file). Once you have done this and connected the hardware properly, then you just have to upload the main file to the arduino board and you are ready to go.

# Results

1. The touchscreen proved to be an extremely effective, albeit costly substitute for an accelerometer-gyroscope sensor, usually used in such systems.
2. The pressure sensitive touchscreen proved to be ineffective for detecting plastic or synthetic rubber ball, but worked fine with metal ball.
3. Re-centering of the ball was successfully achieved with the ball being held reasonably static at any point on the touchscreen.
4. The secondary objective of curve-tracing was also partially achieved, with successful tracing of a circle (video available in Github project folder).

# Future scope

1. The bot&#39;s working provides a brief glimpse of the principle and technology behind most self balancing and self driving vehicles spreading fast through the automobile industry.
2. The bot also serves to provide a good demonstration of balancing a body without using its own momentum, and hence the ability to control its motion and trajectory.
